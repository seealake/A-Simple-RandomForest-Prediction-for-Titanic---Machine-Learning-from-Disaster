# A Simple RandomForest Model Prediction for Titanic

## This my effort as a beginner to try to predict the perpetual competition of ["Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) on kaggle, which I ended up with a accuracy score of 0.799.
## I used RandomForest as my model prediction, with SMOTETomek for sampling.
## If you would like to check my code and make some suggestions (if possible), please check out the file [titanic-RF with SMOTE.ipynb](./titanic-RF%20with%20SMOTE.ipynb). Thank you for leaving any suggestions!
